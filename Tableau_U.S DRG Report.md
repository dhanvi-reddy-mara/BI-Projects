- Collaborated with a team associated with the University of Washington to develop a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) report for a startup.
Utilized Tableau to create data-driven dashboards and reports to assist individuals seeking medical treatment, particularly soon-to-be-retiring elderly individuals facing significant medical expenses.
- Worked with a dataset encompassing summaries for the top 100 DRGs across over 3,000 U.S. hospitals for the years 2011 to 2015, representing approximately 60 percent of total discharges.
  
## Key deliverables included:
- Identification of the DRG with the highest discharges.
- Determination of the body system with the highest discharges.
- Development of a Discharges Dashboard enabling users to:
- Select a specific DRG.
- Choose to view states within the continental USA only.
- Select a time period.
- Visualize a map of states with total discharges.
- Creation of a Hospital Finder Dashboard (2015 data only) allowing users to:
- Select their DRG of interest.
- Input their budget (average total payment) via a slider.
- View a map of hospitals serving the chosen DRG.
- Access a table displaying hospitals along with relevant coverage statistics.
This project showcased strong data analytics and visualization skills, as well as the ability to provide valuable insights in the healthcare and financial sectors.
